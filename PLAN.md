### List of TO-DO's
- [x] Learn about Linux as an oporating system and install it onto the computer
> * Be sure to follow up on the Linux introduction that Ziggy sent you next week
- [x] Install Linux and update/upgrade it
- [x] Using Linux, I used the 'vimtutor' command to learn more about the opporating system Vim
> * You last left off at lesson 5.3 keep going as this is very fun!
### For Tyler -
> > * check [This](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) link out for more information on Linux
> > * Then ask ChatGPT how to access and use Linux on a Chrome computer, I think we should install it and use it for our system
> > * Do some reasearch on VIM as well, I think we should use this as our code editor

### What I did Today
---
#### Part 0 - the epologue
- This is gonna be more of a 'talking through my process' entry than the ones I have been doing. I wanted today to be focused on the coding of everything and setting it all up. This entry will also be a tool for Tyler to following along with as I'll write the steps I've taken today and the code that was implemented. Tyler, if you have not finished the Vim tutor please do so as the next steps will be much more difficult without the knowledge you will gain from that.
- P.S. PLEASE use ChatGPT I would not have been able to do any of this without it. Ask it questions, tell it to rephrase the question if you don't understand it. It really is an mazing tool and is perfect for everything you may have questions for.
---
#### Part 1 - Installing resources
- Today I installed pip, smbus2, and scd4x (in that order) - we will install more as we go along but I just want to get the co2 sensor started today
- Also make sure that python3 is installed as well as vim obviously - Once again ChatGPT was helpful in this process.
---
#### Part 2 - The script
- This script is for the CO2 sensor but some parts may be used for the other sensors we want to add.
- Firstly making sure you have the right imports such as scd4x, smbus2, time and others depending on you 
- First import them below
import smbus2
import time
from scd4x import SCD41
---
Then place this code in your file (your file must end in .py)

    bus = smbus2.SMBus(1)  -# 1 for Raspberry Pi 3/4, 0 for Raspberry Pi 1/2/Zero

    scd41 = SCD41(bus)

    scd41.start_periodic_measurement()

    while True:

        co2_ppm = scd41.read_measurement()
    
        if co2_ppm is not None:
            print(f"CO2 Concentration: {co2_ppm} ppm")
        else:
            print("Failed to read CO2 data")

        time.sleep(2)
 
#### Part 3 - Wrap Up
 - I tried to see if I could get any further with the Raspberry Pi but I couldn't really get anywhere.
 - I hope that on Friday you are able to give it a try. If any of this is confusing please send me a message on Wikr.

### Starting on the Website
- I started by trouble shooting and downloading everything that needed to be downloaded to get React and Vim working together. I downloaded a lot of stuff if you also want to work on the website just ask ChatGPT on how to set everything up
- I made a chart with fake temperature data each point is showing one day and when you hover over the point with your cursor it says Plant Temperatur (C): and then the temperature so once we starting getting data I can put it into the website and we can start getting information down on the plant

## 3/22/2024
### Working on the Website 
- I've started by taking the chart with the fake temperature and removing from the website for now because I was thinking it would be better to make different tabs for different data like one tab could show the temp of the plant and another could show how much light it is getting etc
- I put my essential question into the web page and also the overview of what I am going to be putting on the website
- I also spent some time fixing things in my overview to make it sound better and more understandable

## 3/29/2024
![Screenshot 2024-03-29 12 52 03 PM](https://github.com/DissectCyber/grow/assets/149178495/e37ab9a9-664e-4f3d-94f5-7845b3a89e5d)
### Even More Web Development 
- With my time here today I was able to make a website that has 2 seperate pages (There will be more than 2 page). One of the pages shows my essential question for my project and my project overview. The second page shows the chart that I removed from the website last week but now they are both on the same website and you can go into either of them from the same page.
- Next time I work on the website I want to add more info about my project and also add more pages to website to show more info about the plant.

## 4/5/2024
### Brainstorming ideas for website
- Add more pages that will show more information
  - Different page describing my project so the homepage can be an overview
- Style it to look more visually apealing using css
- Add more information on why I am growing my plant and make the home page more understandable
- Ask around for feedback on the site to see if there anything else I could add
- Offer educational content about the plant species, optimal care practices, and the significance of each type of data being monitored
- Implement security measures to protect the website and your data
- automated watering system that can be triggered manually from the website or trigger automatically when soil moisture levels drop too low.

### How to integrate these ideas into my website
- I need a handfull of empty pages so that I can start adding things onto them which should be the easy part
- Styling the pages should also be easy there might need to be few changes though
- Use information from my bibliography to offer educational content about the plant I will be growing
- I don't know much on to implement security measures to protect my site I will have to more research on how to that so my site is safe
- An automated watering system would be cool but I feel it owuld be something I would do towards the end so it is not a main focus right now
