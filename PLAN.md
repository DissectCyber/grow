#### List of TO-DO's
- [x] Add PLAN.md, SECURITY.md, DEPENDSON.md, UPTIME.md, and PERFORMACE.md to the "grow" repository
- [x] Learn about how Markdown works (work in progress)
- [x] Research how microgreens grow and under what conditions are best to grow them in 
> * Light- More shade? More Light? Do we need to order specific lights?
> * Water - When to water, and how much
> * Location - Not too close to the ventilation but not far away from the light source(?)
> * Possibly put a cover over it?
> * Technologies - Video Feed? Light sensor? 
#### What do we want this to look like?
> Will this turn into a project for us?

> * ~~Light- More shade? More Light? Do we need to order specific lights?~~
> * ~~Water - When to water, and how much~~
> * ~~Location - Not too close to the ventilation but not far away from the light source(?)~~
> *  After doing some research I thought maybe put a cover over it?
- [x] Research technologies that could be useful in the data collecting aspect
> * Video Feed?
> > * <ins>Do we want a website for this?</ins>
> > * Camera: [Official Raspberry Pi Camera Module](https://www.amazon.com/Arducam-Megapixels-Sensor-OV5647-Raspberry/dp/B012V1HEP4/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=raspberry%2Bpi%2Bcamera&qid=1699463919&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1)
> * Sensors
> > * Light - Found that a southern facing window would be best... The ones we have face north but I believe that should be efficient. Some [Photoresisters](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=LDR&tag=754u-20&ref=nb_sb_noss_2) that I thought would work for what we need.
> > * Temperature - 60-75 degrees is best [DS18B20](https://www.amazon.com/Diymore-DS18B20-Digital-Thermometer-Temperature/dp/B01IVN3X6K/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=DS18B20&qid=1699467406&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1)
> > * Humidity - 60-70% humidity is best [DHT22](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Temperature-Humidity-Electronic-Practice/dp/B0795F19W6/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=DHT22&qid=1699467396&sr=8-3&th=1)
> > * Soil Moisture levels - [Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor](https://thepihut.com/products/capacitive-soil-moisture-sensor)
> > * pH sensor - I believe the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor is able to sense for pH but I'm not sure. I coudn't find others that would work for what we needed.
> > * Electrical Conductivity (EC) of soil - I don't belive raspberry pi has anything that can do this but would be glad to be proven wrong!
> > * CO2 Sensor - [SCD41 CO2 Sensor](https://thepihut.com/products/scd41-co2-sensor-breakout-carbon-dioxide-temperature-humidity)
#### For Next Week
* Take a picture of the greens
* Look into the process we will use

> <ins>What did I learn?</ins>
> * How to connect somethings into the pi module
> > * Power adapter, Micro USB, Keyboard, Camera, Display. ETC.
> * Began to connect some and learned a little about the operating system

### List of TO-DO's
- [x] Learn about Linux as an oporating system and install it onto the computer
> * Be sure to follow up on the Linux introduction that Ziggy sent you next week
- [x] Install Linux and update/upgrade it
- [x] Using Linux, I used the 'vimtutor' command to learn more about the opporating system Vim
> * You last left off at lesson 5.3 keep going as this is very fun!
### For Tyler -
> > * check [This](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) link out for more information on Linux
> > * Then ask ChatGPT how to access and use Linux on a Chrome computer, I think we should install it and use it for our system
> > * Do some reasearch on VIM as well, I think we should use this as our code editor
