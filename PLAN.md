> > * ~~Light- More shade? More Light? Do we need to order specific lights?~~
> > * ~~Water - When to water, and how much~~
> > * ~~Location - Not too close to the ventilation but not far away from the light source(?)~~
> > *  After doing some research I thought maybe put a cover over it?
> > * > - [ ] Research technologies that could be useful in the data collecting aspect
> > * Video Feed?
> > > * <ins>Do we want a website for this?</ins>
> > * Sensors?
> > > * Light - Found that a southern facing window would be best... The ones we have face north but I believe that should be eficient.
> > > > * Possibly set up 2 different grow trays. One here where it is facing and one under a grow light? Will ask April for opinion later today.
> > > * Temperature - 60-75 degrees is best
> > > * Humidity - 60-70% humidity is best
> > > * Hypothesis - Can we check for soil dampness/dryness? Should we?
