Found [This](https://www.amazon.com/Moisture-Temperature-Intensity-Environment-Gardening/dp/B09N36NBG2/ref=sxin_16_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?content-id=amzn1.sym.d933e485-817c-414b-a558-8d2dd91be62a%3Aamzn1.sym.d933e485-817c-414b-a558-8d2dd91be62a&crid=35E9UF99U0IKF&cv_ct_cx=plant+temperature+and+humidity+monitor&keywords=plant+temperature+and+humidity+monitor&pd_rd_i=B09N36NBG2&pd_rd_r=93ea5426-743b-4434-9cab-05c8b43d8ebb&pd_rd_w=PHSzs&pd_rd_wg=AO5aM&pf_rd_p=d933e485-817c-414b-a558-8d2dd91be62a&pf_rd_r=68BJAWYB0GYZ3307NA94&qid=1699459467&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sprefix=temperature+monitor+for+pl%2Caps%2C93&sr=1-1-04ee2115-cc39-4a76-b27b-39c36fb3a917-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9zZWFyY2hfdGhlbWF0aWM&psc=1) on amazon and thought it might be useful.
> > > * Light - Found that a southern facing window would be best... The ones we have face north but I believe that should be eficient.
> > > > * Possibly set up 2 different grow trays. One here where it is facing and one under a grow light? Will ask April for opinion later today.
> > > * Temperature - 60-75 degrees is best
> > > * Humidity - 60-70% humidity is best
